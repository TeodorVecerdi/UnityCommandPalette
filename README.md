# Command Palette
On its own Command Palette doesn't do much besides displaying a window.  
There are samples included that showcase how to develop plugins for Command Palette.

## Samples

* **Basic Commands**: Example of setting up simple commands that can be executed, such as opening a scene, creating a new folder, and more.
* **Math Engine**: Perform math calculations without ever leaving the editor. (Based on [PowerToys](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys)' implementation)
* **Color Converter**: Easily convert colors between HEX, RGB(A), HSV(A), and HSL(A).

## Usage

* By default `Alt+]` opens the command palette. (can be configured in `Edit > Shortcuts...`)
* Type a command name and press `Enter`

Other keybinds:

* `Escape` - closes the window
* `Alt+Backspace` - goes back to the main window in case of commands with parameters
